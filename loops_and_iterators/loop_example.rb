# Let's try an example of a loop by creating a file named loop_example.rb

# loop_example.rb

loop do
  puts "This will keep printing until you hit Ctrl + c"
end

# Now we can run ruby loop_example.rb on the terminal and see what happens.

# You'll notice the same statement keeps printing on the terminal. You'll have to interrupt with a Ctrl + c to stop it.
