# You can also use the rescue reserved word in-line like so:

# inline_exception_example.rb

zero = 0
puts "Before each call"
zero.each { |element| puts element } rescue puts "Can't do that!"
puts "After each call"

=begin

This code prints the following output:

Before each call
Can't do that!
After each call

It does so because it isn't possible to call the each method on an Integer which is the value of the zero variable. If we remove the rescue block, the second puts method will not execute because the program will exit when it runs into the error. You can see why the word "rescue" is relevant here. We are effectively rescuing our program from coming to a grinding halt. If we give this same code the proper variable, our rescue block never gets executed.
